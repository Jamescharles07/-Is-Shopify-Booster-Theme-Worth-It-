<p><strong>Booster is a theme with the following features.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sales Notifications</strong></p>

<p><br />
Sale notification is one of the most used features in e-commerce businesses as it helps in increasing the conversion rate. Every time a customer makes a purchase from your store, that purchase will become a notification, and it will appear when other visitors visit your store. By doing this, you are showing your customers that there are other people buying from you. This will help build your reputation, and in turn, encourage your customers to buy.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Upsell products</strong></p>

<p><br />
This feature will help you sell other products to your customers while they are shopping on your site. For example, when a customer is searching for a hat, this feature can recommend products related to that hat, such as a T-shirt or a pair of pants. Don&#39;t assume that your customers know everything in your store or that they will take the time to browse your entire store because they probably don&#39;t. Most of the users come to the website only for what they have in mind and then leave. They will have no idea what other products you are selling, so this feature is very important to show them what you have. This feature is the basis behind upselling campaigns where you can use a low-cost non-profit product to drive visitors to your site, and then cross-sell them with other products that you can use. There is a benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Currency converter</strong></p>

<p><br />
If you sell in different countries, this feature will automatically convert the prices to the currency where the customer is. This feature will help your visitors know what they have to pay immediately, because, otherwise, they probably won&#39;t open a currency converter to change the prices, but just leave.<br />
Page optimization for the product<br />
The product page of Booster Theme is also very well designed and provides every important piece of information that you need to convey to your customers. You have a reliable banner, shortage and urgency, product description, shipping options, and discounts all on one page.

<p><br />
If free plus shipping products are an important part of your strategy, Booster gives you a special function for them! This feature will automatically detect free plus shipping items in your store, and generate a unique button for them. That way, when your customers see free plus shipping items in your store, they know exactly what&#39;s on offer and don&#39;t get confused with your other products.</p>
